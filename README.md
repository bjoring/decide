# Decide

Decide is an event-driven state-machine framework for running behavioral
experiments on node.js. Responses generate interrupts that trigger transitions
between states. All events are logged and can propagate to sockets-based web
interfaces for online monitoring of behavior. Multiple devices can be connected
to a host computer, which can collate data and provide additional monitoring
services, permitting safe maintenance on closed economies. Implementing new
training paradigms involves wiring together states and events and is intended to
require minimal programming skills. The software will support arbitrary hardware
configurations, allowing you to design custom interfaces for your experimental
needs.
