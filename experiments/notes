Time to completely redesign this.

toolkit:
	Will contain all the functions necessary to build experiments.
	Functions will include "cue_left", "wait_for_peck", etc. Ideally,
	building a new experiment will be as easy as putting toolkit 
	functions into a specific order. Perhaps it would even be best
	if the experiment files did not interact at all with
	apparatus?


Protocols: 
	Other stuff should be able to interact with the experiments (
	"start", "stop", and "resume". This will all have to be done
	through the broker.
